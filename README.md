# AI Resume Tailor

### Motivation

My friends and I have been talking recently that we should build some kind of AI solution tool together, which sounds like an interesting idea to me. I started diving into how AI solutions are made. From research, I found out that, most AI solution tools don't actually train their own AI, they use AI technologies that already exist to make an AI wrapper. Cool. So then I got to working.

I wanted to build an AI tool that will help tailor resumes when given the job description of the job that the user is applying for. Being a recent grad, I know how important it is to tailor your resume for each job in order to maximize your chances. This is also one of the most straight forward project that I could do, since this is my first time developing an AI tool.

I'm using Google Gemini's API key since they have a free tier.

### How to Run

1. Clone this repository
2. Change your current directory to the newly cloned project folder: `cd <project-folder-name>`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Put your choice of AI's API key in a .env file
5. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
